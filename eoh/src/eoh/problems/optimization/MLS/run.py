run.py

This module is responsible for:
1) Loading facility-location data (peaks, misreports, weights).
2) Evaluating any user-defined mechanism (heuristic) by:
   - Computing its empirical social cost (per Equation (1) in the paper),
   - Adding a penalty term (Equation (2)) if the mechanism is not empirically strategyproof.
3) Returning a single scalar value (the average fitness) for each evaluated mechanism.

Reference to Paper Sections:
- Section 2 (Preliminaries): Describes the data structure (peaks, misreports, weights).
- Section 3.3 (Fitness Evaluation): Explains how we compute the sum of agent distances to
  the nearest facility (social cost) and enforce strategyproofness via a regret penalty.
